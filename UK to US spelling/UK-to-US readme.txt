The British-to-American dictionary 'UK-to-US.csv' uses the list at 
http://www.tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html, 
purged of all -is, -lys, and -our forms that are handled separately 
(this purging is done in reduce_BAdict). 
As a result, we only need to look at 541 of the original 1800-plus entries.
