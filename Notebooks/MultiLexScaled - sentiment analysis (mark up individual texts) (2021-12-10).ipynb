    "\n",
    "Our calibration is based on newspaper articles. This has two important implications for valence calculations of short test sentences that may appear counter-intuitive:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The mean valence of a newspaper article in our representative corpus, as measured by every single one of our lexica, is greater than zero. (This is shown in the list of 'means' displayed when the calibration data are loaded in the next code snippet.) As a result, a sentence that has no valenced words in it at all is (comparatively) negative, rather than neutral, as one might expect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The average newspaper article in our representative corpus is 743 words long. We scale the valence sums encountered by this length, since a single positive word in a 743-word text is far less noticeable than that single positive word by itself. As a result, a 'text' consisting of that single positive word is going to get a strikingly high valence score. To put it differently, the single word 'happy' gets a score of over 63, but so does 'happy happy' and 'happy happy happy ...' ad infinitum. So our valence scores are best interpreted as though the text were repeated back-to-back-to-back up to the average length of a newspaper article. Rather than imagine what the text would look (and 'feel') like repeated back-to-back-to-back, we also divide our calculated valence by the ratio of the length of a test text to the average text length for which the scaler was generated."
